The user wants to know the match schedules for February 28, 2024.
I have a function called `matchschedules` that can fetch this information.
The function takes `day`, `month`, and `year` as parameters.
I will call this function with the provided date.

The parameters for the `matchschedules` function are:
- `day`: 28
- `month`: 2 (for February)
- `year`: 2024

I will construct the function call with these parameters.
After receiving the response, I will format it in a user-friendly way.
The response hint shows the expected structure of the data returned by the function. I will use this to understand how to present the information.
I will list each match with its time, home team, away team, venue, and broadcast information.
